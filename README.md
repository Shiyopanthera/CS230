# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client has a successful android app called Draw It or Lose It. They were looking to expand their player base by developing their game into a web-based platform. This game would retain the same playstyle and visuals as the mobile app, but also be able to reach many more players.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I work as a UAT tester, so creating and following a design document feels comfortable. I'm used to seeing this format for Business Requirement Documents (BRD) and this was quite similar. Rather than focusing on a single enhancement or change, this software design document was a high level overview of the entire project.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The domain model was helpful. Seeing a UML helped me understand how the code should be interacting and helped me determine what needed to be done.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
In the evaluation section, I break down the Development Requirements for different operating systems. As I continue to learn, gaining knowledge and experience with different platforms, I'm sure this section could become more refined and maybe even change as time progresses and technology adapts.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The client wanted only one instance of a game at any time. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
